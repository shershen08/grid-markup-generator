This is the first version of browser based UI editor based on Kickstart HTML/CSS bootstrap (http://www.99lime.com/). Editor prototype was developed in mid 2013. It relies in jQuery, jQueryUI and underscoreJS librabies.

Project's code needs refactoring. Planned date for global refactoring: 15th August 2014.
